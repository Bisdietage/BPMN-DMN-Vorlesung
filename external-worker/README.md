# External Worker

This directory includes a pre-built external worker; you can add your own.


## Structure

External workers are categorized by programming language and process application.
Each worker directory contains a Dockerfile for containerization, necessary source
code, and a README with a brief description. Language-specific templates are
available in the templates directory.


## How to Use

Build your external worker via Docker and Run the container.

Creating new external workers: Copy the corresponding template and create a new directory for your external worker.
